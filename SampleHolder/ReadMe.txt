Printing:
- Use PLA. Doesn't require any particular slicing settings. After printing ensure the part is flat and has not warped or curled up during printing. 

Attach other hardware:
- After printing insert the brass heat-set insert using soldering iron or specific tool. After waiting for it to cool screw in the M3x24 screw loosely into the heat-set insert.

Inserting into microscope:
- Remove the original metal objective holder from the stage by undoing the four screws
- Attach the 3D printed sample holder to the stage using the same four screws
- Slide the Nikon 10x objective into the 3D printed holder to the correct height 
- Tighten the M3x24 screw until just enough tension is applied to prevent the objective from slipping down. Don't over tighten. 
- Ask us for advice if needed
